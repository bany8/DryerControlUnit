# Fixing-my-dryer

## Description
The electronics of the **WARTMANN WM-2006 DH** food dryer (used for mushrooms, fruits, etc.) got wet and rusted.  
I decided to repair it and share how I did it.

The dryer already included:
- 230 VAC power input socket  
- power switch  
- 230 VAC fan  
- 230 VAC heater  

All schematics are in the **/Docs** folder, and photos are in **/Photos**.  
I could have reused the original resistive temperature sensor, but I didn’t notice it at first.<br>
Code is prepared in PlatformIO (VSCode extension) and you can find it in **/Dryer arduino/src**.
